to use this api, first install python3 (available from the microsoft store)
then run the command "pip3 install flask"
then add flask to your PATH enviroment variable if its not already there (the cmd commands should give you the file location for it)
run the cmd command "flask run" in the folder with app.py

(Note, we may have to add sqlalchemy to the pip3 install commands, and maybe a graphql thing too)
